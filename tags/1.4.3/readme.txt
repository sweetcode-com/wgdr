This plugin integrates the Google AdWords Dynamic Remarketing Tracking pixel with customized ecommerce variables in a WooCommerce shop.

== Description ==

Do you have a WooCommerce shop and want to run dynamic remarketing campaigns with Google AdWords? This plugin will insert the customized remarketing pixel on all your shop pages. Google AdWords will then be able to collect customer behaviour data (product viewers, buyers, order value, cart abandoners, etc). Based on this data you will be able to run targeted remarketing campaigns.

<strong>Requirements</strong>

* WooCommerce
* WooCommerce Google Product Feed plugin or something similar to upload the products to the Google Merchant Center
* Google Merchant Center Account with all products uploaded
* AdWords account with a configured remarketing tag

<strong>Highlights of this plugin</strong>

* Very easy to install
* Very accurate. Several methods have been build in to avoid tracking of shop managers, deduplication of purchases, etc.

<strong>Installation support</strong>

Installing the plugin is pretty simple. Just activate it and enter the conversion ID and if necessary the product prefix.

If you also need to to set up the Google Merchant Center first the entire setup becomes more complex. If you would like us to do the setup for you please contact us for an offer: support@wolfundbaer.ch

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does AdWords report an error? =

Give AdWords time to pick up the code. It can take up to 48 hours. 

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

Download the Google Tag Assistant browser plugin. It is a powerful tool to validate all Google tags on your pages. Bear in mind that validating the Merchant Center Feed only works on product pages.

= The plugin messes up my theme. What is happening? =

It has been reported in several occasions that minifaction plugins, such as Autoptimze, mess up the Javascript code which lead to errors in the theme. The Javascript code for the tracking needs to be placed exactly as Google requires it. To solve this issue turn off the minification plugin.

= I am getting following error: "We haven’t detected the Google Analytics remarketing functionality on your website." What can I do? =

This plugin doesn't support Google Analytics Remarketing, only Google AdWords Remarketing (as the plugin name says).

= I am getting following error: "There are problems with some of your custom parameters for Retail." What can I do? =

Give AdWords time to pick up the code. It can take up to 48 hours.

= I am getting following error: "Only 20 of 50 page visits that have passed an ID (or 40%) match IDs in your Merchant Center feed." What can I do? =

It indicates that not all products have been uploaded to the Google Merchant Center. As long as you don't upload all of them you will see this error.

Also it could be that you haven't waited the 48 hours time period until AdWords has processed everything properly.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please report your bugs and support requests in the support forum for this plugin: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-dynamic-retargeting-tag

We will need some data to be able to help you.

* Website address
* WordPress version
* WooCommerce version
* WooCommerce theme and version of the theme
* The AdWords remarketing tags conversion ID and conversion label

(Most of these information is publicly viewable on your webpage. If you still want to keep it private don't hesitate to send us a support request to support@wolfundbaer.ch)

= Why does AdWords report that the ecomm_prodid are not found? =

* After installation wait a few days. It can take that long until all is processed correctly.
* You need the prefix only if you use the WooThemes Google Product Feed plugin.
* Check if you really have loaded all products into the feed and into the Google Merchant Center.
